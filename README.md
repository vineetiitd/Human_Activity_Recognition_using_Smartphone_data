# Human_Activity_Recognition_using_Smartphone_data
An experiment have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope data I aim to built a ML model to predict the activity based on this dataset.
